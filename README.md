# [Nifty Web Apps](https://kevinl.info/nifty-web-apps/)

**Build a web app for any programming assignment.**

While many students now interact with web apps across a variety of smart devices, the vast majority of our [Nifty Assignments](http://nifty.stanford.edu/) still present traditional user interfaces such as console input/output and desktop GUI. In this tutorial session, participants will learn to build simple web apps for programming assignments that execute student-written code to dynamically respond to user interactions, resulting in a much more modern app experience. Our approach requires up to 75% less code than similar desktop GUI apps while requiring few (if any) modifications to existing assignments. Instructors and students alike can run and modify these web apps on their own computers or deploy their apps online for access from any smart device at no cost. The tutorial presents examples from CS1 and CS2 courses in Python and Java, but the ideas apply generally.
